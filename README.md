# BYU-Cubesat
Preliminary code written for cubesat from 2019-2020, when part of the BYU Spacecraft Club. Specifically, my team worked on:

With our purpose and goal of launching our module into space being to collect data and understand temperature gradients across the module itself, we will be attaching eight sensors: seven temperature and one Inertial Mass Unit (IMU). The primary purpose of the IMU is to try to detect the orientation of our satellite. Similarly, we will be using the temperature sensors throughout the satellite to find which side is oriented towards the sun. We will also utilize the temperature sensors to detect overheating of any parts of the satellite itself; if it overheats we will shut down the module and perform restart.
